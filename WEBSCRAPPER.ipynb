Family outings etc) – in short management touches every  one irrespective of their work or station in life.\n",

Thus as values change,  concepts change, new economic and the workplace gets more and more competitive  and complex – there is a need to learn and acquire the new knowledge.  There has been enormous research and  development in the field of management over the past few decades.  New equations need new process and solutions.\n",
